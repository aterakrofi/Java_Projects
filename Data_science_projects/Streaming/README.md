implement a python program that could interact with high velocity streaming data. My goal was to create a program that can visualize the streamed data   as it changes with time 
For this project, I considered testing my program against Real time Weather update from http://api.openweathermap.org/. I would focus on charting temperature changes between California and New Jersey

Tkinter is a program for building GUI’s for python programs while Matplotlib is a library used to aid in data visualization. The source code for this implementation was based on tutorials from
